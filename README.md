# PINNS-For-Spaghetti-Bridges

A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) implementation for analyzing and predicting the structural behavior of spaghetti bridges. This project uses machine learning to model the complex physics of bridge structures made from spaghetti, incorporating both data-driven and physics-based approaches.

## Project Overview

This project implements a Physics-Informed Neural Network to analyze various aspects of spaghetti bridge structures, including:
- Structural integrity
- Load-bearing capacity
- Stress distribution
- Deformation analysis
- Failure prediction

## Features

- Integration of physical constraints into neural network training
- Prediction of maximum failure loads
- Analysis of various structural parameters including:
  - Bridge dimensions
  - Material properties
  - Cross-sectional properties
  - Support conditions
  - Load characteristics

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installation
